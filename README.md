## The Problem

Companies conduct engagement surveys, but insights are buried in thousands of free-text comments. Manual analysis is:
- **Time-Consuming**: HRBPs spend weeks reading and categorizing comments.
- **Subjective**: Inconsistent categorization prone to individual interpretation.
- **Slow**: Analysis takes so long that feedback becomes outdated.
- **Superficial**: Manual analysis misses subtle trends and correlations.

**Time cost**: 40-60 hours per survey for a mid-sized company  
**Quality issues**: Inconsistent tagging, missed insights, shallow reports  
**Business Impact**: Delayed action on critical feedback, decreased morale, increased attrition

## The Solution

An AI-powered workflow that automatically analyzes qualitative survey feedback:
1. Ingests survey responses directly from tools like SurveyMonkey or Google Sheets.
2. Uses GPT-4 to perform sentiment analysis (Positive, Negative, Neutral) on each comment.
3. Identifies and categorizes primary themes ("Career Growth", "Work-Life Balance", "Management").
4. Generates an executive summary with key findings, sentiment breakdown, and illustrative quotes.
5. Delivers a structured report to HR and leadership teams.
